# Sprint Timer

**Use the published web app:**

As the purpose of this project was to work on my front-end web development skills this app is not secure, therefore do not use your real email address and password.

You can use: example@example.com; password: 123456 to test the app, or you can create a new account with a fake email address.

**Project description:**

This React with Redux web app allows the user to upload a video of them sprinting. The user can then use a slider such that when it slides, the video frame that is displayed changes. This allows the user to conveniently display the frame where the user started the sprint and the frame where the user finished the sprint. The app then calculates and displays the time of the sprint. 

Different users can login with their individual credentials. Users can store their video record information including: the video itself; the sprint time; the date of the sprint; the category of the sprint (e.g. 40m sprint). These records can be filtered by category, sprint time or date. The users can modify their video record information.
